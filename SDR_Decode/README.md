# SDR Decode 

## what needed 

### subject ([LUM-LT-RF-RGBW-01](https://shop.gsmet.be/Article/ArticleDetails/a050e3fa-6031-46fb-9c97-5524d6bc4817))
The target device is a **LED controller** that operates with an RF remote. The goal is to capture the communication between the remote and the controller and decode it as much as possible.  
The datasheet specifies that it uses the **433.92 MHz** frequency band.
### SDR ([RTL SDR](https://www.hfelectronics.be/shop/scanners/600-rtl-sdr.html))
A **low-cost USB stick SDR** is being used, which costs around â‚¬25 and supports the required frequency range.  
If the target operates on a higher or lower frequency, ensure the SDR can handle that range.

### SDR software ([SDR#](https://airspy.com/download/))
For software, I opted for **SDR# (SDRSharp)**

```

#### Method one

It looks like there are two symbols: `1000` and `1110`. When converting `1000` into `A` and `1110` into `B`, it transforms into this:

```
ABAABBBBAAAABBABBAAAAAAAAAA
```
Splitting it further into bytes gives (two to 5 symbols to short):
```
ABAABBBB AAAABBAB BAAAAAAA AAA
```

#### Method two

If you replace it with `00` = A, `01` = B, `10` = C, and `11` = D, you get:
``` 
CADCCACADCDCDCDCCACACACADCDCCADCDCCACACACACACACACACACA
```
Splitting it further into bytes results in (two to 2 symbols to short):
``` 
CADCCACA DCDCDCDC CACACACA DCDCCADC DCCACACA CACACACA CACACA
```

This seems more promising. However, there may have been a few `00` pairs discarded due to lack of context. It's also unclear where zeros were missed at the front or back of the sequence.

### Identifying Patterns in Signals

When using the first method for additional button presses, a pattern becomes clear. By correlating signal changes with the action performed, the following table summarizes the discovered relationships:

|                                        |      | ID       | channel | CMD  | DATA     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ---- | -------- |
| **Button 1 ON**                        | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | AAAB    | BBAA | AAAAAAAB |
| **Button 1 OFF**                       | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | AAAA    | BBAA | AAAAAAAA |
| **Button 2 ON**                        | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | AABA    | BABB | AAAAAAAB |
| **Button 2 OFF**                       | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | AAAA    | BABB | AAAAAAAA |
| **Button 3 ON**                        | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | ABAA    | BABA | AAAAAAAB |
| **Button 3 OFF**                       | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | AAAA    | BABA | AAAAAAAA |
| **Button 4 ON**                        | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | BAAA    | BAAB | AAAAAAAB |
| **Button 4 OFF**                       | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | AAAA    | BAAB | AAAAAAAA |
| **ALL Buttons (Pressing W)**           | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | BBBB    | ABAB | BBBBBBBB |
| **ALL Buttons (Trying pressing RED)**  | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | BBBB    | AAAA | ABBBBBAB |
| **ALL Buttons (Trying pressing BLUE)** | ABA  | ABBBBAAA | BBBB    | AAAA | ABABABBB |

> Note: When holding the button, the signal repeats, but instead of ABA, it starts with AABA. This appears to act as a flag to indicate that the signal has already been received, preventing repeated activation.

## Result

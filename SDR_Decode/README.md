# SDR Decode 

## what needed 

### subject ([LUM-LT-RF-RGBW-01](https://shop.gsmet.be/Article/ArticleDetails/a050e3fa-6031-46fb-9c97-5524d6bc4817))
The target device is a **LED controller** that operates with an RF remote. The goal is to capture the communication between the remote and the controller and decode it as much as possible.  
The datasheet specifies that it uses the **433.92 MHz** frequency band.
### SDR ([RTL SDR](https://www.hfelectronics.be/shop/scanners/600-rtl-sdr.html))
A **low-cost USB stick SDR** is being used, which costs around â‚¬25 and supports the required frequency range.  
If the target operates on a higher or lower frequency, ensure the SDR can handle that range.

### SDR software ([SDR#](https://airspy.com/download/))
For software, I opted for **SDR# (SDRSharp)**
